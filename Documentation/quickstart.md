# Quickstart Guides

Welcome to Rook! We hope you have a great experience installing the Rook **cloud-native storage orchestrator** platform to enable highly available, durable storage
in your Kubernetes cluster.

If you have any questions along the way, please don't hesitate to ask us in our [Slack channel](https://rook-io.slack.com). You can sign up for our Slack [here](https://slack.rook.io).

Rook provides a growing number of storage providers to a Kubernetes cluster, each with its own operator to deploy and manage the resources for the storage provider.

**Follow these guides to get started with each provider**:

| Storage Provider           | Status      | Description                                                                                                                                            |
